NOTE: Apply to --target=arm-none-symbianelf builds only.

This works around the problem of TRK overshooting line-wise stepping by a few
instructions. This is not a gdb problem, but a TRK problem, but currently
easier to workaround on the gdb side. It's sufficient to apply for the
arm-none-symbianelf targeted gdbs only as TRK is the only probe known to have
this problem.
