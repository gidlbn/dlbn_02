property <name> <name> : <name>
if you delete the last name as you tab through it should also delete the : colon as that is not needed.

----------------
Item {
	id: <name>
	
	}
If you delete the name maybe the 'id:' should be deleted as well.

This is fine for most other QML elements such as Rectangle and MouseArea

----------------

BorderImage {
    id: <name>
    width: <name>; height: <name>
    border.left: <name>; border.top: <name>
    border.right: <name>; border.bottom: <name>
    source: "<name>"
}

-------------------

Image {
    id: <name>
    source: "<name>"
}

----------------

Text {
    id: <name>
    text: "<name>"
}
