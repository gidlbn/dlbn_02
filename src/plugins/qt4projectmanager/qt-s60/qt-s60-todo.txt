* SDK overview page:
    * When the refresh button is pressed
      the qtoptionspage is not updated to reflect the new versions
      though we update them in S60Manager

* QtVersion:
    * gui for overriding the default make target if necessary,
      make arguments --> make options
    * build parser should be defined/created by toolchain, not make step

* Tool chains
    * Qt4Project::setQtVersion should think about tool chains,
      might be better to remove the magic in toolChainType method
    * should the default make target be defined by the project
      instead of tool chain, or perhaps by the QtVersion dependent on a
      tool chain?
    * seems that the make for building for device doesn't return useful exit code,
      so a run is started even if the build has errors

* Run on device
    * passphrase for signing
    * time stamp of copied sisx is ridiculous
    * don't copy the sisx all the time
    * don't hardcode copy destination
    * isRunning is wrong
