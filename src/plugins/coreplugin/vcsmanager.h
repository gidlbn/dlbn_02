/* VCSManager:
 * 1) Provides functionality for finding the IVersionControl * for a given
 *    filename (findVersionControlForDirectory). Note that the VCSManager assumes
 *    that if a IVersionControl * manages a directory, then it also manages
 *    all the files and all the subdirectories.
 *    It works by asking all IVersionControl * if they manage the file, and ask
 *    for the topmost directory it manages. This information is cached and
 *    VCSManager thus knows pretty fast which IVersionControl * is responsible.
 * 2) Passes on the changes from the version controls caused by updating or
 *    branching repositories and routes them to its signals (repositoryChanged,
 *    filesChanged). */
